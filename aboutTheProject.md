#Background

My client has a bed and breakfast, restaurant, gallery, and shop in rural Poland.
She has people visiting and staying for holidays.
Many of these visitors are keen historians.

#Aim

The aim is to create an imformative app, that could also be used while staying in the area.
Linking historic buildings, cultural centres and places of interest.
The aim is to share information about the area and to learn from it.

#Features

##Search
- Search for, find and view historic buildings/cultural centres/points of interest on the map

##Content
- Read information, look at multimedia content, related to the place
- upload and edit relevant content

##Routes
- search and view suggested routes
- possibly create a route [if this doesn't overcomplicate the app]
[or, alternatively, track people's routes using GPS, and generate a visual?]
