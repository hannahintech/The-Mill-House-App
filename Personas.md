I’m the manager of a small bed and breakfast. I have a website but it's not used much and mostly people turn up or hear of me via word of mouth. I have a lot of knowledge about the local area and I am passionate about sharing it. I am not technically literate and prefer the physical world, however, I have people who help me when I need it.
I am always looking for ways to share the information I have and educate people about the local area. I also love to offer my guests something a little more personal as well as share what I know about great things to do and see nearby.

*“Sharing your life, your experiences and what you have with others is what makes life beautiful”*
